 ## Description

This project was created using Microsoft Access. 

The accounts ledger serves as a central hub for managing financial activities, facilitating effective financial management and reporting. Users are able to analyze financial data through queries and generate reports for better decision-making. A general ledger represents the record-keeping system for a company's financial data, with debit and credit account records validated by a trial balance. The database helps to organize and streamline financial processes, enhancing overall efficiency and transparency.
